# Crossover

## Contents of Repository
The majority of Crossover's core source code can be found in the `src` folder. 
Built-in packages, such as HTML support, can be found in the `builtin` folder. This folder is where contributions will be most widely accepted. Inside this `builtin` folder, there is a folder of C# scripts that form the core system (`sys`) module. The `sys` module is the only folder inside the `builtin` folder that will contain C# code. All other packages inside the folder will be comprised of Crossover code.
The `samples` folder contains sample scripts of Crossover code. These stand as guides as to how Crossover should be written.
