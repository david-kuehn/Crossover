# Crossover

##What is Crossover?
Crossover is a programming language intended to link together the development of the frontend and backend sides of a website. Essentially, you will write code in Crossover, and it will generate the necessary frontend components, like HTML and Javascript, as well as the necessary backend components, in Node.js. These generated binaries will be linked together automatically when your Crossover code is compiled, but you can still go back and customize any of the frontend or backend code if you need to.
