# Crossover
##### Note:
Please do not download this source code with the intention to USE the Crossover language. **YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMPILE YOUR CODE.** Refer to Notice A for more information.

## What is Crossover?
Crossover is a programming language intended to link together the development of the frontend and backend sides of a website. Essentially, you will write code in Crossover, and it will generate the necessary frontend components, like HTML and Javascript, as well as the necessary backend components, in Node.js. These generated binaries will be linked together automatically when your Crossover code is compiled, but you can still go back and customize any of the frontend or backend code if you need to.

## Contents of Repository
The majority of Crossover's core source code can be found in the `src` folder. 
Built-in packages, such as HTML support, can be found in the `builtin` folder. This folder is where contributions will be most widely accepted. Inside this `builtin` folder, there is a folder of C# scripts that form the core system (`sys`) module. The `sys` module is the only folder inside the `builtin` folder that will contain C# code. All other packages inside the folder will be comprised of Crossover code.
The `samples` folder contains sample scripts of Crossover code. These stand as guides as to how Crossover should be written.

#### NOTICE A:
Compilers are not included in this repository and may only be obtained from the official Crossover website (pending) for licensing reasons.
